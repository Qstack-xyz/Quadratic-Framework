# Quadratic Voting & Funding Framework

This framework provides an efficient, secure, and user-friendly way to implement quadratic voting and funding on various blockchains. By utilizing this, developers can empower communities to make decisions in a more democratic manner and fund projects that prioritize community interests.

### Introduction

Quadratic mechanisms allow for more democratic decision-making and resource allocation. Their underlying principle is to amplify the impact of many small contributors.

### Supported Blockchains
- Algorand
- (more to be added...)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourGithubUsername/Quadratic-Voting-and-Funding-Framework.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd Quadratic-Voting-and-Funding-Framework
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Usage

1. Navigate to the appropriate directory for your blockchain of choice.
2. Deploy the associated contracts.

### Blockchain Implementations

#### Algorand

- **Voting**: Navigate to the `contracts/algorand/voting` directory and deploy the `QuadraticVotingContract.algo` on the Algorand blockchain.
- **Funding**: Navigate to the `contracts/algorand/funding` directory and deploy the `QuadraticFundingContract.algo`.

(More blockchains to be added as the project progresses.)
