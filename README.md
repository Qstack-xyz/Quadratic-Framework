# Quadratic-Framework
 A Unified and Modular Quadratic Funding and Voting Implementation 

 Quadratic-Voting-and-Funding-Framework
README.md

    Description: This framework provides an efficient, secure, and user-friendly way to implement quadratic voting and funding on the Algorand blockchain. By using this framework, developers can empower communities to make decisions in a more democratic manner and fund projects in a way that prioritizes community interests.

Introduction.md

    Purpose: Introduce the concepts of quadratic voting and funding.
    Benefits: Highlight the advantages of using quadratic mechanisms over traditional ones.
    Framework Overview: A brief summary of how the framework operates.

QuadraticVoting.md

    Concept: What is quadratic voting and why is it important.
    Implementation Details: How the contract handles the voting mechanism, calculation, voter registration, and result tabulation.
    Integration: Guide on how to integrate the voting contract with other systems.

QuadraticFunding.md

    Concept: Introduction to quadratic funding.
    Implementation Details: Discusses how the contract pools funds, calculates matchings, and disburses funds.
    Integration: Guide on integrating the funding mechanism with other applications, perhaps web interfaces or mobile apps.

IntegrationGuide.md

    Setup: Getting started with the framework.
    APIs: List of available APIs and their usage.
    Example Integrations: Showcase of some projects using the framework.

contracts/

voting/

    QuadraticVotingContract.algo: Main contract handling quadratic voting mechanism. This should be developed in such a way that it's easily modifiable to accommodate different voting scenarios.

funding/

    QuadraticFundingContract.algo: Contract for quadratic funding. It should handle the collection of funds, the matching algorithm, and the distribution of funds based on the voting results.

frontend/

src/

    components/: Individual UI components, such as voting buttons, funding widgets, and display charts.
    utils/: Utilities for calculations, interfacing with Algorand, etc.
    App.js: Main application file.

public/

    Assets like icons representing voting, funding, etc.

package.json:

    Include dependencies such as algosdk, react, and any other required libraries.

backend/

    server.js: Main server file.
    api/: Contains route handlers for various endpoints, like vote, fund, getResults, etc.
    utils/: Backend utilities for interfacing with the blockchain, managing the database, etc.
    database/: A potential folder if there's a need for a database to manage users, past votes, and funded projects.

tests/

voting/

    Test scripts ensuring that the quadratic voting mechanism works as expected.

funding/

    Tests to ensure the fund pooling, matching, and disbursing are correct.
